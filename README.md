# 🛠️ Installing (pre-built binaries)
- Download the [latest .zip release](https://github.com/Beastwick18/genshin-real-time-notes/releases/latest) from the releases tab.

  - Select "Evergreen Standalone Installer"
  - WebView2 comes pre-installed on Windows 11, so you may not have to install it.
- Extract this to wherever you would like it to be installed.
- Run either `resin.exe` for Genshin, or `stamina.exe` for Honkai: Star-Rail.
- A login window should appear prompting you to login to your Hoyolab account.
